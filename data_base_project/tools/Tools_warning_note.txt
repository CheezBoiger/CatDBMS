Warning Note:
These data structures and sorting functions DO NOT provide any try catch blocks for any possible errors that may 
occur in your program. This means, if there are problems that may result in one of the data structures or sorting
functions that result in the exiting of the program, keep in mind that there is no stack unwinding! Any files currently
open, or objects loaded in automatic storage time will not be cleaned up, which could mean file will not be stored properly 
or may not have saved any new information!
