# CatDBMS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!
As you may know, this is not a working, functional database management system yet, I plan on developing it and finishing by 
the end of December 2017. This means, I have tons of work to do on this data base, so please if you have any recommendations, 
comments, insults, or anything, please get in contact with me, I would very much appreciate it. Collaboration work on this
management system would be awesome.

# CatDBMS 
CatDBMS is a data base management system designed to hold and store files securely and proficiently! It will be able to 
provide the utmost best security, store data by hashing and encrypting, as well as send information securely, by means of
encryption as well. This management system will be intended to work proficiently by giving the programmer, or user, 
the best control over the application, by telling it what they want this system to do, such as how to sort information,
how to encrypt and hash information, and how to store files securely and economically. It is intended to be lightweight, 
robust, adaptable, and maintainable, so as to be able to stay backwards compatible, as well as provide the best security 
possible! 

# Side note
This would most likely be like no other data base system you've seen. It may have both relational and object database models, but 
that I am not saying that it will be this exactly. Please, I am a noob, I'm doing this as a hobby ;.;
